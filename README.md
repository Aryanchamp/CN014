Problem Statement = Spam Email Detection <br>


<h2> PLAN </h2>
We are implementing a formal machine learning pipeline for spam email detection using a labeled dataset. It leverages NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn (including train_test_split and TfidfVectorizer), and Logistic Regression for data manipulation, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The pipeline encompasses data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, and performance assessment using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, a web application would be integrated for user interaction.
